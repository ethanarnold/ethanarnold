I' build tools at the intersection of AI and research/education. Based in NYC, affiliated with NYU.

## Currently building

### [phosphor](https://github.com/ethanarnold/phosphor)
AI tool that surfaces research opportunities by matching a lab's capabilities (equipment, expertise, past work) against emerging directions extracted from scientific literature. Ranks by feasibility and alignment, generates grounded protocols. Built with FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL + pgvector, and LiteLLM.

### [toughcrowd](https://github.com/ethanarnold/toughcrowd)
Presentation practice tool that simulates a tough audience in real time. Uses live speech-to-text and slide context to generate realistic questions as you speak. React + TypeScript, powered by the Anthropic API.

### [GitGood](https://github.com/ethanarnold/GitGood)
Interactive CLI that teaches GitHub Flow through hands-on simulation. Students practice real `git` and `gh` commands in a virtual repository with progressive lessons and real-time feedback with no risk to actual repos. Python, Rich, prompt-toolkit.
